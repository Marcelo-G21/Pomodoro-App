## üí° Why use React with Vite?

### Vite

Vite is an ultra-fast **bundler** that allows for incredibly low development reload times and improves the developer experience. Some of the reasons Vite was chosen in this project are:

- **Speed**: Initial load is extremely fast thanks to its ESModules-based compiler.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Vite allows code changes to be instantly reflected in the application without the need for a full reload.
- **Simple configuration**: Compared to other solutions such as Webpack, Vite has a simpler out-of-the-box configuration.

### React

React is a **modular library** that allows you to create reusable components and maintain a unidirectional data flow for applications of any scale. We chose React because:

- **Componentization**: It facilitates the creation of complex user interfaces by decomposing them into smaller, reusable components.
- **Virtual DOM**: Optimizes performance by updating only DOM elements that have changed.
- **Broad community and ecosystem**: React has a large support community and a vast number of tools and libraries that facilitate development.


## üõ†Ô∏è Main functionalities

- **Timer start and pause**: Allows users to easily start and stop the timer.
- **Work and rest time setting**: Users can customize the duration of their work and rest sessions.
- **Session control**: Features reset and time adjustment buttons to maintain full control of the timer.
- **Messages and alerts**: The user will be notified when a session ends or when the break time starts.
